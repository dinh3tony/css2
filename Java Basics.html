            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a 
            variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility to take it in a bunch of
            different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can b connected
            to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="subcontents3">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <p id="list">Variable Declaration</p> JavaScript variables are containers for asking data values - imagine a cup fill 
                    with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a varaible holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. 
                    These unique names are called identifiers.<span id="purple">var x;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p id="list">Variable Assignment</p> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - cup can now have coffee poured
                    in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
                    <span id="purple">var = 10;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p id="list">Data Types</p> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on a variables you need to know the data
                    type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span id="purple">true</span> or 
                    <span id="purple">false;</span> null - <span id="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span id="purple">42</span>
                    or <span id="purple">3.14159;</span> String - <span id="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - 
                    <span id="purple">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']</span> and Object - <span id="purple">{first_name: 'Jane',last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p id="list">Conditionals</p> When you write code, you want to perform differnt actions for different decisions - hitting different
                    code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There
                    are the following conditional statements: <span id="purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;
                    <span id="purple">else if</span> to specify a newa condition to test, if the first condition is false;
                    <span id="purple">else</span> we excute this block of code;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p id="list">Loops</p> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essnetially do the same thing:
                    they will repeaer an action of some numaber of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you
                    stop. That's a loop!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <p id="list">Function</p> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run our code block. Think of 
                    it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a deask from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get 
                    started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we p[lace the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instrutions. Sadly there are 
                    a ton more tables to do so lets call our funtion over and over and over again.
